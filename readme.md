# Catmostphere
A management software for small coffee shop

## Basic introduction
- The program used a simplified MVC (model-view-controller) model
| Section    |  Functional Duty                                |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| model      | handling the business logic and modify the data |
| view       | handling the end user I/O and interface         |
| controller | acting as the bridge between the other two      |

- Since the data is relatively small, I don't use any database sys so we don't have to learn 
**Note**: The code is designed in WSL (windows subsys linux) so if you run this in window, you might want to check the path string in files (linux user '/' instead of '\' so maybe it won't run)
